# Overload-and-Overheating_detection
Developed a system using STM32 and NanoEdge AI to monitor motor load and temperature in real-time. Designed to prevent motor failure by detecting overload and overheating conditions with NanoEdge AI

Interfaced current sensors and temperature sensors with STM32 to gather live motor health data.

Used NanoEdge AI Studio to train a lightweight anomaly detection model based on normal operation data—no pre-labeling required.
